      "\n",
      "- **Seamless Human–AI Collaboration**: Everyday devices—from smart homes to wearables—will embed AI that anticipates needs, adapts to user preferences, and operates in real‑time. Think of a “digital companion” that can draft emails, schedule meetings, and even suggest creative ideas based on your mood and context.\n",

      "| 3 | **Spread Peanut Butter** | 1. Place one slice of bread on the surface.  <br>2. Spread peanut butter evenly across the entire slice, reaching the edges. | For a lighter sandwich, use less peanut butter or a thin layer. |\n",
      "| 4 | **Spread Jelly** | 1. Place the second slice of bread on the surface.  <br>2. Spread jelly evenly over the entire slice, again reaching the edges. | If you like a sweeter sandwich, add a drizzle of honey on top of the jelly. |\n",
      "| 5 | **Combine the Slices** | Gently press the peanut‑butter‑side of the first slice onto the jelly‑side of the second slice. | Press lightly to keep the sandwich together but avoid crushing the bread. |\n",
      "| 6 | **Optional Enhancements** | • Butter the outer sides of the sandwich and toast it in a skillet or sandwich press.  <br>• Add sliced banana, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a pinch of sea salt for extra flavor. | Toasting adds crunch and warmth; just watch the butter so it doesn’t burn. |\n",
      "| 7 | **Cut & Serve** | 1. Use a sharp knife to cut the sandwich in half (diagonal or straight).  <br>2. Serve immediately or wrap for later. | Cutting diagonally gives a larger surface area for each bite. |\n",
